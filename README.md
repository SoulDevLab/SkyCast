# 🌦️ SkyCast

**SkyCast** is a very beginner-created weather app that lets you check the weather for any city with a clean interface, animated background, and real-time updates. This project was made to help me learn web development by building something practical and fun.

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the excellent work of [Reza Mehdikhanlou](https://github.com/rezamehdikhanlou) and his project [100 Days of JavaScript – Day 10 Weather App](https://github.com/AsmrProg-YT/100-days-of-javascript/tree/master/Day%20%2310%20-%20Weather%20App).

As a complete beginner, I took some parts of his HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as a foundation, especially the layout and certain logic pieces. I adapted and mixed those with my own code and ideas to create something unique for myself. The project is **partially based on his code, but much of it is written and customized by me** as part of my learning journey.
